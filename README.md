This repo contains the data and tools needed to build and publish my personal
webiste at [https://dev.pippi.im](https://dev.pippi.im). HTML contents are
generated from Markdown sources using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on
GitHub Pages. A GitHub workflow automatically deploys the website at every
commit on the `main` branch of this repo.
