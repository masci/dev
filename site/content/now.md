Yet another [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

# Work

I joined [Elastic](https://elastic.co) mid-pandemic in 2020 as a Senior Engineering Manager - changing
job during the pandemic felt weird and was emotionally challenging but there isn't any other place
I'd like to be during these funky times; I can work from home, fully supported in taking care of the
family (myself included) whenever I need to.

# Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- After being on a diet during the whole winter and spring 2020/2021, I touched my lowest weight in May 2021.
  These days I'm not following any strict regimen, I'm more into "good habits" when it comes to food. I
  took back about 3 kilograms but staying on this weight is effortless at this point.
- I'm still teaching myself basic financial education, I should've done this 25 years ago but I like
  thinking it's never too late to start doing the right thing.
- I keep practicing guitar, my gear consists of a [Seagull S60][seagull s60] acoustic guitar and an
  [Acus One Forstrings 5T][acus one] amplifier. I recently acquired a travel guitar, a
  [Crafter Mino][crafter mino] and it's unbelievable how much more I'm playing it compared to the S60. I
  think the fact that's smaller and lighter (along with a great sound and volume) makes super easy to pick
  it up whenever I have a second to sit down.
- I keep adding notes to my Zettelkasten and I finally used to [write something!](https://dev.pippi.im/writing/sourcing-360-degree-feedback/)
