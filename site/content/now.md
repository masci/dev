Yet another [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

# Work

I joined [deepset](https://deepset.ai) mid 2022 as the Team Lead for Open Source Engineering. It's an early stage startup,
a challenge that's also an immense learning resource (and something that was sitting on my professional TODO list :). The
culture is great and they're good and talented people working on disruptive technology. Wearing multiple hats, I have the
chance to revamp my coding skills, keep growing as a manager and learning a lot about product management. And 100% Open Source.

# Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- Quoting myself from the last update: "I'm not following any strict regimen, I'm more into "good habits" when it comes to food".
  ...aaaaand I peaked at 108 and had to go back on a diet, yay!
- I'm building a house! (I mean, I'm paying professionals to do that, but it's built on my specs!)
- I keep practicing guitar and studying music, my gear consists of a [Seagull S60][seagull s60] acoustic guitar and an
  [Acus One Forstrings 5T][acus one] amplifier. I recently acquired a travel guitar, a
  [Crafter Mino][crafter mino] and it's unbelievable how much more I'm playing it compared to the S60. I
  think the fact that's smaller and lighter (along with a great sound and volume) makes super easy to pick
  it up whenever I have a second to sit down.
