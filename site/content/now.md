Yet another [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

# Work

I joined [Elastic](https://elastic.co) a few months ago as a Senior Engineering Manager - changing
job during the pandemic felt weird and was emotionally challenging but there isn't any other place
I'd like to be during these funky times; I can work from home, fully supported in taking care of the
family (myself included) whenever I need to.

# Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- I've been on a diet for 3 months now and I feel much better, unfortunately gyms are closed and
  I don't feel like exercising at home _at all_.
- I'm teaching myself basic financial education, I should've done this 25 years ago but I like
  thinking it's never too late to start doing the right thing.
- I keep practicing guitar despite the lockdowns prevented me to attend school. My gear consists
  of a [Seagull S60](http://www.seagullguitars.com/en/products/160-s6-original-qit) acoustic guitar
  and an [Acus One Forstrings 5T](https://www.acus-sound.it/en/one-forstrings/5-oneforstrings-5t.html)
  amplifier.
- I keep adding notes to my Zettelkasten.
