Yet another [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/nowff).

# Work

I joined [Elastic](https://elastic.co) one year ago as a Senior Engineering Manager - changing
job during the pandemic felt weird and was emotionally challenging but there isn't any other place
I'd like to be during these funky times; I can work from home, fully supported in taking care of the
family (myself included) whenever I need to.

# Life

Random stuff that's going on:

- After being on a diet during the whole winter and spring, I touched my lowest weight in May. With the
  lockdown being lifted it was impossible to keep up with a strict diet AND meals with friends and family,
  so I've started relaxing a bit the requirements, so to speak. I keep eating healthy and according to the
  general directions from my nutritionist, I hit the gym 3 times per week, I gained back some weight but
  I feel good and I'm still 7 kilograms below where I started.
- I'm teaching myself basic financial education, I should've done this 25 years ago but I like
  thinking it's never too late to start doing the right thing.
- I keep practicing guitar, my gear consists of a [Seagull S60][seagull s60] acoustic guitar and an
  [Acus One Forstrings 5T][acus one] amplifier. I recently acquired a travel guitar, a
  [Crafter Mino][crafter mino] and it's unbelievable how much more I'm playing it compared to the S60. I
  think the fact that's smaller and lighter (along with a great sound and volume) makes super easy to pick
  it up whenever I have a second to sit down.
- I keep adding notes to my Zettelkasten so I think it's time to use my Zk to write something :)
