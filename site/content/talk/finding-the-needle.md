Haystack is an open-source framework. With Haystack you can compose various NLP tools to build applications, with a
particular focus on Large Language Models. Haystack was built before the “ChatGPT revolution”. Same as many others in
this industry, we had to question all the existing assumptions in order to adapt, and we had to do it fast.

In this talk, we'll explore the motivations behind the refactoring, the challenges we faced, and the outcomes achieved
through this intensive process. From rethinking many of the original abstractions, all the way up to growing a vibrant
community of users and contributors, we’ll share the key strategies and techniques employed during this journey.

Whether you're a seasoned open-source contributor or a curious enthusiast, this talk promises to uncover valuable
insights and lessons learned from the evolution of Haystack.
