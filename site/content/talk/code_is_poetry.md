Yes, code might be poetry, showing the elegance of the verses, rhythm, expressiveness; 
but without good documentation that explains what it does, you will likely end up with 
unsatisfied users or no users at all.

If anyone had told me I would have spent more time writing documentation than coding, 
I would not have believed it, but that was before I discovered a simple but powerful 
law: “more documentation, more users, more contributors”.

During the talk we will see which are the foundations of good documentation and how 
documentation can let your open source project take off.
