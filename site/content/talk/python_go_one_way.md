Rumor has it recently that a growing number of Python developers are migrating to Go through an impressive series of success stories;
even if we don't know the real numbers and it's difficult to make a detailed picture of this phenomenon, the fact that Python
devs are interested in Go is out of the question, just go to some mailing list, blog or Twitter account and check out yourself.

During the talk we will see what Go can offer that is so attractive for a Pythonista to make them migrate code, tools, behaviours.
We'll also try to understand if this journey to the Land of Gophers can be one way or it's better for a Python dev to buy the
return ticket in advance.
