Django was actively supported at an early stage of the Python runtime in App Engine SDK 
through the notable django-nonrel framework, a fork of the original project that adds 
support for NoSql databases. But starting from the App Engine SDK 1.6.2, released more 
than two years ago, you can instead deploy Django’s official releases and take advantages 
from the whole stack of the framework.

In less than half an hour we’ll see how we can easily deploy the latest version of Django 
on the Google Cloud Platform, taking advantage of the tools and services provided by 
App Engine, Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.
