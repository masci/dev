This is a must read for your non-tech savvy audience: parents, kids, your friends
who think they know how to navigate the Internet. It's not very technical and can be
easily understood with a minimum of familiarity with the modern devices that are
normally available in our houses.

It's also an entertaining reading for the professionals, containing plenty of tales
that most certainly have affected their digital life at some point; even if you already
know about those, the way Mikko recounts the events it's worth it reading the book, I
went cover to cover in less than a week.
