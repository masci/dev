I am a bit disappointed with this book, because compared to other titles, this is solely dedicated to the role
of Staff Engineer and I was hoping it could go in depth and give more actionable suggestions. Turns out the
only practical advices you can get out of it are in the first pages - it could've been a blog post. I wouldn't
recommend it.

Things I liked:
- A few good points in the first part of the book
- I appreciate he disclosed the interview format he used with notable staff engineers from various companies

Things I didn't like:
- The first part is too shallow and it's nothing new
- The second part is overly repetitive, you read one interview you read them all.
