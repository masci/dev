At the time I'm writing, this is the best book you can read to form an opinion
around the "dysfunctions, risks, and flaws of generative models"
that very rarely reach the mainstream.

The book is good for novices: one of the first chapters introduces common definitions
for all the topics covered, and the language is always accessible even when the
author is referring to some technical detail. Anyways, grasping the deep meaning of technical
details is not a requirement for enjoying the book.

For the AI experts, this book is a goldmine of good references. If you don't agree on
something, you can still go check out the paper or article the author is basing his
thoughts.
