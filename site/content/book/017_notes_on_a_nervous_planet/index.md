First book I read from the author, I'm now curious to read the others. For being an essay the prose is a bit strange,
some chapters are shorts, some longer, some seem aphorisms... But you get used to it pretty fast and you get more and
more into the point of view of the author as you progress.

<!--more-->

The prose can get technical at times (the author is really tech savvy), but I would encourage anyone to read it.
I'll take away some lessons and several resolutions from this book. I already moved the phone charger away
from my bedroom!
