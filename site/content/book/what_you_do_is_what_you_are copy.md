Great read as any biography from Walter Isaacson, it's a massive volume but it was very enjoyable and fast to read.
Love him or hate him, Musk is a very influential individual for our time, and the book unveiled for me several
details about the events that made him "Elon". I really appreciated the details around his working philosophy:
the urgency, his "engineering first" attitude, his morbid attraction for problems that seem impossible to solve.
Even if there's proof that working for is unhealthy in many different ways, I think there's still something to learn
there.
