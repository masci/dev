The authors keep saying a sort of mantra during the book: **HRT**, an acronym that stands
for Humility, Respect and Trust. Apply this mantra and you will soon become an excellent
team player, whatever your job is.

As a software developer and a team member, I know how difficult is dealing with people in
respect of writing code sitting comfortably at my desk, so I am usually very skeptical of
technical books that promise to teach you how to deal with this "human stuff" like it was
a programming language. I had the pleasure to meet Brian Fitzpatrick at a conference and
I was very impressed by his brilliant personality and his fascinating personal story and
this somehow convinced me on reading this book. And I was not disappointed because since
the first pages you have the strong feeling you're reading something written by developers,
so you mostly and easily get the point of the authors.

The book is full of good advices, best practices and even a list of antipatterns you better
avoid to apply to your team. Some of the advices derives from common sense and you or your
team likely apply them already, nevertheless it was very useful realizing how important some
behaviors, habits or attitudes me and my team already have but wrongly take for granted,
or worst, miss to improve.

I'll do my best to have my colleagues read this book.
