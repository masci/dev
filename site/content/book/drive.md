I read this book because a colleague highly recommended it to me, but it took me a while to get into it. The basic
concept of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation is really easy to grasp, but at a first glance the book might seem
repetitive. Well, it's not, and the many details and nuances around the main concept are the real value proposition
of this book.

I collected plenty of highlights from the book that apply to both my work and personal experience, note for myself: go
review them periodically!

I don't recommend picking this up as the traditional "management manual", it doesn't work like that :).
