This is the first product-management hands-on book I read, and for somebody starting
from zero, I think it does a good job at setting the reader on the right path towards
answering the question "How do you build a product that delights users?". For me it's
a reference book - I started experimenting some techniques described in the first
chapters with my team before finishing the book, and I keep going back to it as
I get more experience on USM. Probably not a great book for a casual reading about
product management, also because it tends to be repetitive.

Things I liked:
- The book is all about keeping focus on the users.
- If you're stuck in software requirements gathering like me, the book is a breath
  of fresh air.
- You can get started experimenting with USM super fast.
- It's full of tiny practical advices, checklists, stuff you can incorporate into
  your own process right ahead.

Things I didn't like:
- The first part is great to get you started, but illustrations are terrible and it's
  a pity because they would help you a lot grasping the USM concept.
- After you start experimenting the techniques in real life, you wish you had more details.
- Some concepts and metaphors are repeated over and over: the boulder, the cake, the asteroid...
  They are all great but it feels confusing at some point, probably the book would be still
  great with half the pages.
