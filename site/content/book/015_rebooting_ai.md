The book accurately describes the problems with the current trend of AI development, problems from which large language
models and tools like ChatGPT greatly suffer. Only the book was written _before_ ChatGPT! It's impressive how actual the
book can be, and even more impressive is learning how these problems have been known for years now and the industry
seems to just not care.

The book is also a friendly introduction to the modern AI techniques in general and to generative AI in particular,
I would recommend it to newcomers for a quick ramp-up.
