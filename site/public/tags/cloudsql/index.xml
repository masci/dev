      <description>Intro Django was actively supported at an early stage of the Python runtime in App Engine SDK through the notable django-nonrel framework, a fork of the original project that adds support for NoSql databases. But starting from the App Engine SDK 1.6.2, released more than two years ago, you can instead deploy Django&amp;rsquo;s official releases and take advantages from the whole stack using Google Cloud Sql.
Case study We&amp;rsquo;re going to setup a minimal project using Zinnia, a blog engine built on top of Django and a fairly complex web application that leverages several components of the framework, a good benchmark for showing how easy can be deploying on App Engine.</description>
