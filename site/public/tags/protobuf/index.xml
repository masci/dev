      <description>This blog post was hosted in the Datadog Engineering Blog, you can read it here.
Recently we extended the Datadog Agent to support extracting additional metrics from Kubernetes using the kube-state-metrics service. Metrics are exported through an HTTP API that supports content negotiation so that one can choose between having the response body in plain text format or as a binary stream encoded using Protocol buffers.
Binary formats are generally assumed to be faster and more efficient, but being Datadog we wanted to see the data and quantify the improvement.</description>
