      <p>Very inspiring, going through the book was like listening to the author telling his story to a friend. The style is
minimalistic, no tricks to produce more pages, no repetitions, always straight to the point.
It really makes you want start your own business, and not for the money but rather for the journey and fulfillment.</p>

      <p>First book I read from the author, I&rsquo;m now curious to read the others. For being an essay the prose is a bit strange,
some chapters are shorts, some longer, some seem aphorisms&hellip; But you get used to it pretty fast and you get more and
more into the point of view of the author as you progress.</p>

      <p>At the time I&rsquo;m writing, this is the best book you can read to form an opinion
around the &ldquo;dysfunctions, risks, and flaws of generative models&rdquo;
that very rarely reach the mainstream.</p>

      <p>The book accurately describes the problems with the current trend of AI development, problems from which large language
models and tools like ChatGPT greatly suffer. Only the book was written <em>before</em> ChatGPT! It&rsquo;s impressive how actual the
book can be, and even more impressive is learning how these problems have been known for years now and the industry
seems to just not care.</p>

      <p>Great read as any biography from Walter Isaacson, it&rsquo;s a massive volume but it was very enjoyable and fast to read.
Love him or hate him, Musk is a very influential individual for our time, and the book unveiled for me several
details about the events that made him &ldquo;Elon&rdquo;.</p>

      <p>I can&rsquo;t recall another time when reading a book made me uncomfortable. The book is supposed to teach you how to set up
a strong culture in your company but to do so it uses examples from: a controversial military leader, a feudal system
well known for its rigid hierarchies, a perpetrator of multiple genocides and last but not least, a prison gang leader.
I kinda see the idea behind the book, but the execution is terrible, peaking with the cringey quotes from rap songs at
the beginning of each chapter. The book contains great stories and good insights but you have to dig, not sure it was
worth it.</p>

      <p>This book is a masterpiece: the metaphor of the atlas, the many thorough notes, the data behind each chapter is just
amazing. The author also shows fine technical skills that let her jump from politics to hardware and algorithms
flawlessly as the narrative requires. This book is an eye-opener for those who think about modern AI as &ldquo;software&rdquo;,
whereas the environmental and human costs are massive.</p>

      <p>I am a bit disappointed with this book, because compared to other titles, this is solely dedicated to the role
of Staff Engineer and I was hoping it could go in depth and give more actionable suggestions. Turns out the
only practical advices you can get out of it are in the first pages - it could&rsquo;ve been a blog post. I wouldn&rsquo;t
recommend it.</p>

      <p>This is the first product-management hands-on book I read, and for somebody starting
from zero, I think it does a good job at setting the reader on the right path towards
answering the question &ldquo;How do you build a product that delights users?&rdquo;. For me it&rsquo;s
a reference book - I started experimenting some techniques described in the first
chapters with my team before finishing the book, and I keep going back to it as
I get more experience on USM. Probably not a great book for a casual reading about
product management, also because it tends to be repetitive.</p>

      <p>This is a must read for your non-tech savvy audience: parents, kids, your friends
who think they know how to navigate the Internet. It&rsquo;s not very technical and can be
easily understood with a minimum of familiarity with the modern devices that are
normally available in our houses.</p>

      <p>Must-read for anybody interacting with other cultures, whether it&rsquo;s for work or not. I had several ah-ah! moments
reading the book, it can be a life-saver if you struggle at times navigating people situations: very often it&rsquo;s a
cultural problem that you&rsquo;re facing, and you can work around it if you know where it stems from.</p>
<p>Can be used as a reference tool, getting to the part you need in the moment.</p>

      <p>Very much like &ldquo;The Manager&rsquo;s Path&rdquo;, this is another book you should keep on your desk
and access randomly as you need it. Most of the &ldquo;small things&rdquo; target upper management
but I recommend this book to line managers and individual contributors too as this is
a good reference for what you should expect from your manager.</p>

      <p>The book consists of two, very different parts, plus a case study from the ING bank. Part one
is a must read explanation of how DevOps practices can massively impact the business in a positive
way and why. The second part is an explanation of the science that supports the claims presented in
Part two.</p>

      <p>I liked the fact that the book is short, goes straight to the point, contains mostly
practical advices and methods to manage an engineering team (the target audience in my
opinion is line managers). Similarly to &ldquo;The Manager&rsquo;s Path&rdquo; by Camille Fournier, you
can keep this book on your desk and use it whenever you need it, like a manual.</p>

      <p>I was skeptical at first because leadership and management style in the military are not really
my cup of tea, but this is different: the author seems to have the same feelings, except he was
a submarine commander in the US Navy.</p>

      <p>I read this book because a colleague highly recommended it to me, but it took me a while to get into it. The basic
concept of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation is really easy to grasp, but at a first glance the book might seem
repetitive. Well, it&rsquo;s not, and the many details and nuances around the main concept are the real value proposition
of this book.</p>
<p>I collected plenty of highlights from the book that apply to both my work and personal experience, note for myself: go
review them periodically!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend picking this up as the traditional &ldquo;management manual&rdquo;, it doesn&rsquo;t work like that :).</p>

      <p>I believe this is the mother of all the management books I&rsquo;ve read so far: I can trace
back most of the concepts that nowadays are common in engineering management to a
paragraph, or a simple quote from this book.</p>

      <p>The authors keep saying a sort of mantra during the book: <strong>HRT</strong>, an acronym that stands
for Humility, Respect and Trust. Apply this mantra and you will soon become an excellent
team player, whatever your job is.</p>
