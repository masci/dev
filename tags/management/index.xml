      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very inspiring, going through the book was like listening to the author telling his story to a friend. The style is&#xA;minimalistic, no tricks to produce more pages, no repetitions, always straight to the point.&#xA;It really makes you want start your own business, and not for the money but rather for the journey and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The coding interview in 2025</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/the-coding-interview-in-2025/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted several hundreds of interviews, written coding exercises, and even designed entire hiring&#xA;pipelines. I&amp;rsquo;ve also screwed up, many many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the fence, I use AI coding tools frequently but not daily. I&amp;rsquo;m very aware of when they&amp;rsquo;re a&#xA;productivity boost and when they&amp;rsquo;re a waste of time, money, and resources. Coding assistants are evolving incredibly&#xA;fast, and I know first-hand how staying current with them takes time and commitment. I&amp;rsquo;m also experiencing how using&#xA;them to write more and more of my code, I tend to forget the finer details of languages and libraries. While I think&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s unacceptable for a software engineer not being able to use generative AI tools on the job in 2025,&#xA;including this aspect into the hiring process is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/book/what-you-do-is-what-you-are/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall another time when reading a book made me uncomfortable. The book is supposed to teach you how to set up&#xA;a strong culture in your company but to do so it uses examples from: a controversial military leader, a feudal system&#xA;well known for its rigid hierarchies, a perpetrator of multiple genocides and last but not least, a prison gang leader.&#xA;I kinda see the idea behind the book, but the execution is terrible, peaking with the cringey quotes from rap songs at&#xA;the beginning of each chapter. The book contains great stories and good insights but you have to dig, not sure it was&#xA;worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of Leadership</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/book/art-of-leadership/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very much like &amp;ldquo;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&amp;rdquo;, this is another book you should keep on your desk&#xA;and access randomly as you need it. Most of the &amp;ldquo;small things&amp;rdquo; target upper management&#xA;but I recommend this book to line managers and individual contributors too as this is&#xA;a good reference for what you should expect from your manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accelerate</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The book consists of two, very different parts, plus a case study from the ING bank. Part one&#xA;is a must read explanation of how DevOps practices can massively impact the business in a positive&#xA;way and why. The second part is an explanation of the science that supports the claims presented in&#xA;Part two.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sourcing 360 Degree Feedback</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/sourcing-360-degree-feedback/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 19 Nov 2021 17:11:35 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/sourcing-360-degree-feedback/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 360 degree feedback (or just &amp;ldquo;360 feedback&amp;rdquo;) is named after the multiple sources from where the&#xA;feedback is gathered: it can be upward (from somebody reporting to that person), downward (from that&#xA;person&amp;rsquo;s managers) and lateral (from a peer, or from a cross-functional team member). I don&amp;rsquo;t resort&#xA;very often on the 360 feedback &amp;ldquo;as a process&amp;rdquo;, but it admittedly provides several advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s useful to uncover blind spots: other people look at things from a different angle and might&#xA;help you surface the unexpected&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more balanced: you get (or give) feedback gathered from a diverse group of individuals instead&#xA;of just one person, lowering the impact of the bias that will inevitably come with the feedback&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes resort to 360 feedback in situations where these advantages shine: for example when&#xA;I know I have several blind spots to cover (took a new reporter, joined a new organization) or to&#xA;prepare performance reviews or promotion cases, where I can&amp;rsquo;t afford my positive or negative bias to&#xA;have a crucial impact.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Resilient Management</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/book/resilient-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dev.pippi.im/book/resilient-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked the fact that the book is short, goes straight to the point, contains mostly&#xA;practical advices and methods to manage an engineering team (the target audience in my&#xA;opinion is line managers). Similarly to &amp;ldquo;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&amp;rdquo; by Camille Fournier, you&#xA;can keep this book on your desk and use it whenever you need it, like a manual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why did you move to management?</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/why-did-you-move-to-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 11:31:38 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/why-did-you-move-to-management/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I get various declinations of the same question: &lt;em&gt;why did you decide to move&#xA;to engineering management?&lt;/em&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily in job interviews: it might be a colleague, somebody&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m mentoring, or a friend of mine. Even my wife asks, sometimes out of genuine curiosity, other&#xA;times more in a &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;why did you do this to yourself&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; fashion - so I thought it might be interesting to&#xA;articulate an answer in written form.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the mother of all the management books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far: I can trace&#xA;back most of the concepts that nowadays are common in engineering management to a&#xA;paragraph, or a simple quote from this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I manage a small team with the help of Trello</title>
      <link>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/manage-with-trello/</link>

      <guid>https://dev.pippi.im/writing/manage-with-trello/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not about agile management theory, something I know very little about; this is what I do to keep a small team of engineers on track without allocating 100% of my time to management. If you keep reading, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how I didn&amp;rsquo;t invent anything and how this is only &amp;ldquo;yet another way&amp;rdquo; of composing existing tools and practices in order to implement a process that works for me. So why another post?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The authors keep saying a sort of mantra during the book: &lt;strong&gt;HRT&lt;/strong&gt;, an acronym that stands&#xA;for Humility, Respect and Trust. Apply this mantra and you will soon become an excellent&#xA;team player, whatever your job is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
