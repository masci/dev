      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very inspiring, going through the book was like listening to the author telling his story to a friend. The style is&#xA;minimalistic, no tricks to produce more pages, no repetitions, always straight to the point.&#xA;It really makes you want start your own business, and not for the money but rather for the journey and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Great read as any biography from Walter Isaacson, it&amp;rsquo;s a massive volume but it was very enjoyable and fast to read.&#xA;Love him or hate him, Musk is a very influential individual for our time, and the book unveiled for me several&#xA;details about the events that made him &amp;ldquo;Elon&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What You Do Is Who You Are: How to Create Your Business Culture</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t recall another time when reading a book made me uncomfortable. The book is supposed to teach you how to set up&#xA;a strong culture in your company but to do so it uses examples from: a controversial military leader, a feudal system&#xA;well known for its rigid hierarchies, a perpetrator of multiple genocides and last but not least, a prison gang leader.&#xA;I kinda see the idea behind the book, but the execution is terrible, peaking with the cringey quotes from rap songs at&#xA;the beginning of each chapter. The book contains great stories and good insights but you have to dig, not sure it was&#xA;worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Must-read for anybody interacting with other cultures, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for work or not. I had several ah-ah! moments&#xA;reading the book, it can be a life-saver if you struggle at times navigating people situations: very often it&amp;rsquo;s a&#xA;cultural problem that you&amp;rsquo;re facing, and you can work around it if you know where it stems from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can be used as a reference tool, getting to the part you need in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
