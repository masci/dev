      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I had the chance to play with the first Beta of &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-actions&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noreferrer&#34;&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;but for some reasons it didn&amp;rsquo;t click for me: the point-and-click interface, the&#xA;HCL syntax and the confusion in the market place put me back to my comfort zone,&#xA;in the good company of the usual CI/CD systems we all have been using for years now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to a few weeks ago, when GitHub announced that Actions were finally&#xA;approaching general availability; a couple of days later, my personal GitHub&#xA;account was promptly enrolled in the Beta program. It was time to give it another&#xA;try, and this is the story of my second attempt at learning Actions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
