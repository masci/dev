      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a bit disappointed with this book, because compared to other titles, this is solely dedicated to the role&#xA;of Staff Engineer and I was hoping it could go in depth and give more actionable suggestions. Turns out the&#xA;only practical advices you can get out of it are in the first pages - it could&amp;rsquo;ve been a blog post. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t&#xA;recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
