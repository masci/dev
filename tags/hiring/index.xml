      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted several hundreds of interviews, written coding exercises, and even designed entire hiring&#xA;pipelines. I&amp;rsquo;ve also screwed up, many many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the fence, I use AI coding tools frequently but not daily. I&amp;rsquo;m very aware of when they&amp;rsquo;re a&#xA;productivity boost and when they&amp;rsquo;re a waste of time, money, and resources. Coding assistants are evolving incredibly&#xA;fast, and I know first-hand how staying current with them takes time and commitment. I&amp;rsquo;m also experiencing how using&#xA;them to write more and more of my code, I tend to forget the finer details of languages and libraries. While I think&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s unacceptable for a software engineer not being able to use generative AI tools on the job in 2025,&#xA;including this aspect into the hiring process is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
