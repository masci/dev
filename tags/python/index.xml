      <description>What is poetry? Before starting, let’s agree on some terminology. Obviously poetry is a literary form, a way to write down things I would say, but how do you recognize it, how can you say that is poetry and this is not? Well, according to my literary heritage (I’m italian) something is poetry when it has verse, rhyme and stanza; let’s see what they are and how we can recognize them.</description>

      <description>Intro On of the features of Django Appengine Toolkit is simplifying the work needed to configure Google Cloud Storage as a static files storage for Django applications running on Google App Engine. Infact all you have to do is writing something like this in your settings.py module:
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code&amp;gt;APPENGINE_TOOLKIT = { &amp;#39;APP_YAML&amp;#39;: os.path.join(BASE_DIR, &amp;#39;app.yaml&amp;#39;), &amp;#39;BUCKET_NAME&amp;#39;: &amp;#39;media-uploads&amp;#39;, } DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = &amp;#39;appengine_toolkit.storage.GoogleCloudStorage&amp;#39; STATICFILE_STORAGE = &amp;#39;appengine_toolkit.storage.GoogleCloudStorage&amp;#39; &amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt; A complete example This repo contains a minimalistic Django project implementing a file storage application that lets users upload, listing, retrieve and delete files.</description>

      <title>Create a blog in minutes on App Engine with Django and Cloud Sql</title>

      <description>Intro Django was actively supported at an early stage of the Python runtime in App Engine SDK through the notable django-nonrel framework, a fork of the original project that adds support for NoSql databases. But starting from the App Engine SDK 1.6.2, released more than two years ago, you can instead deploy Django&amp;rsquo;s official releases and take advantages from the whole stack using Google Cloud Sql.
Case study We&amp;rsquo;re going to setup a minimal project using Zinnia, a blog engine built on top of Django and a fairly complex web application that leverages several components of the framework, a good benchmark for showing how easy can be deploying on App Engine.</description>

      <description>Foreword GitHub has a very nice notification system, very similar to a plain old email inbox. You receive a notification which remains unread until you actually read it; then it&amp;rsquo;s archived and removed from your inbox, which it happens could remain empty:
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Django ships a library for displaying &amp;ldquo;one-time&amp;rdquo; messages to the users, it&amp;rsquo;s called Message Framework and you can find it in the contrib package.</description>
