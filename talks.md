## If code is poetry, then documentation is prose

### 24th May 2014 

> Pycon Cinque (Italian Python Conference) - Florence

Yes, code might be poetry, showing the elegance of the verses, rhythm, expressiveness; but without good documentation 
that explains what it does, you will likely end up with unsatisfied users or no users at all.

If anyone had told me I would have spent more time writing documentation than coding, I would not have believed it, 
but that was before I discovered a simple but powerful law: “more documentation, more users, more contributors”.

During the talk we will see which are the foundations of good documentation and how documentation can let your 
open source project take off.
