        From time to time, I get various declinations of the same question: why did you decide to move
to engineering management? It&rsquo;s not necessarily in job interviews: it might be a colleague, somebody
I&rsquo;m mentoring, or a friend of mine. Even my wife asks, sometimes out of genuine curiosity, other
times more in a &ldquo;why did you do this to yourself&rdquo; fashion - so I thought it might be interesting to
articulate an answer in written form.

        <p>From time to time, I get various declinations of the same question: <em>why did you decide to move
to engineering management?</em> It&rsquo;s not necessarily in job interviews: it might be a colleague, somebody
I&rsquo;m mentoring, or a friend of mine. Even my wife asks, sometimes out of genuine curiosity, other

for my career. I&rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href="https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">pendulum</a> concept, and I&rsquo;ve being swinging way
before I knew how it was called, jumping back and forth between coding and different degrees of
leadership roles:</p>

<p>IC (9y) -&gt; Tech/Team Lead (5y) -&gt; IC (1y) -&gt; Team Lead (2y) -&gt; IC (2y) -&gt; Team Lead (1y <em>so far</em>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These days I&rsquo;m working hard to become a better engineering manager, but I can&rsquo;t exclude that I might
go back to full time coding in the future, hopefully even as a better programmer. I like to talk
a lot about <a href="https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">drivers</a> in my job, so here follows a list of what
<em>drives</em> me towards engineering management.</p>
<h3 id="driver-n1-amplifying" class="relative group">Driver n.1: Amplifying <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#driver-n1-amplifying" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>Often times I took the lateral step to management because I needed to move forward something that
was just too heavy for an IC: one time it was to organize a team the way I envisioned, another time to help
with hiring, another time to deliver a risky project that was stalling, or that time that I picked
up the lead role on the team that nobody wanted to join (probably the biggest success in my career
so far ❤️). I like to build stuff that works and that&rsquo;s useful to people, and as an IC this can be
achieved through a very well crafted piece of code implementing a certain feature; but as a manager,
I can achieve a goal through a full fledged team capable of a bigger impact on the product than my
code alone could ever have.</p>
<h3 id="driver-n2-talent-spotting" class="relative group">Driver n.2: Talent Spotting <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#driver-n2-talent-spotting" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>At the risk of sounding blatant, I would say I&rsquo;m a more than decent software engineer at this
point. Still, there&rsquo;s something I can do even better: it takes me no time to tell when I&rsquo;m not
the best engineer in the room, and when this happens, I tend to naturally switch into low-ego
mode and do my part, eager to learn more than to lead. This helped me countless times and gave
me the opportunity to learn a lot from complex projects (and complex people), even when my
contributions were modest. As an engineering manager, I very often leverage this attitude to
acknowledge somebody&rsquo;s potential and do whatever I can to let it emerge, and this feels as good
and natural to me as writing good code.</p>
<h3 id="driver-n3-climbing-the-ladder-please-dont-do-this" class="relative group">Driver n.3: Climbing the ladder (please don&rsquo;t do this) <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#driver-n3-climbing-the-ladder-please-dont-do-this" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>It happened that being able to climb the career ladder in a company was part of my decision process to
accept a management role. While there are still companies that (irresponsibly) don&rsquo;t provide a career path
for ICs, this shouldn&rsquo;t be a valid reason to switch to management: I got lucky and things turned out good
for me in the end, but what if I became unsatisfied or even frustrated for not getting what I expected?
The risk is to <strong>actually hurt people</strong>, and rest assured most of those issues are not fixable.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions" class="relative group">Conclusions <span class="absolute top-0 w-6 transition-opacity opacity-0 -start-6 not-prose group-hover:opacity-100"><a class="group-hover:text-primary-300 dark:group-hover:text-neutral-700" style="text-decoration-line: none !important;" href="#conclusions" aria-label="Anchor">#</a></span></h3><p>I like mentioning these three drivers when I try to explain why did I become an engineering manager,
but reality is obviously more complex than this. Since I tend to go back and forth between coding and
management, I find myself in the need to make decisions more often than people with a more &ldquo;stable&rdquo;
career, and the factors contributing to such decisions are many and possibly different
every time. Several of those are negative factors (frustration, money, pride, boredom even) so it&rsquo;s
important for me to recognize them and bring back the focus solely on drivers number one and two.</p>
