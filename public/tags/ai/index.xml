      <title>The coding interview in 2025</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve conducted several hundreds of interviews, written coding exercises, and even designed entire hiring&#xA;pipelines. I&amp;rsquo;ve also screwed up, many many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the fence, I use AI coding tools frequently but not daily. I&amp;rsquo;m very aware of when they&amp;rsquo;re a&#xA;productivity boost and when they&amp;rsquo;re a waste of time, money, and resources. Coding assistants are evolving incredibly&#xA;fast, and I know first-hand how staying current with them takes time and commitment. I&amp;rsquo;m also experiencing how using&#xA;them to write more and more of my code, I tend to forget the finer details of languages and libraries. While I think&#xA;it&amp;rsquo;s unacceptable for a software engineer not being able to use generative AI tools on the job in 2025,&#xA;including this aspect into the hiring process is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Intelligence Illusion: a practical guide to the business risks of Generative AI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/intelligence-illusion/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the time I&amp;rsquo;m writing, this is the best book you can read to form an opinion&#xA;around the &amp;ldquo;dysfunctions, risks, and flaws of generative models&amp;rdquo;&#xA;that very rarely reach the mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rebooting AI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The book accurately describes the problems with the current trend of AI development, problems from which large language&#xA;models and tools like ChatGPT greatly suffer. Only the book was written &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; ChatGPT! It&amp;rsquo;s impressive how actual the&#xA;book can be, and even more impressive is learning how these problems have been known for years now and the industry&#xA;seems to just not care.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Atlas of AI</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/book/atlas-of-ai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This book is a masterpiece: the metaphor of the atlas, the many thorough notes, the data behind each chapter is just&#xA;amazing. The author also shows fine technical skills that let her jump from politics to hardware and algorithms&#xA;flawlessly as the narrative requires. This book is an eye-opener for those who think about modern AI as &amp;ldquo;software&amp;rdquo;,&#xA;whereas the environmental and human costs are massive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
