      <title>The Culture Map</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Must-read for anybody interacting with other cultures, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for work or not. I had several ah-ah! moments&#xA;reading the book, it can be a life-saver if you struggle at times navigating people situations: very often it&amp;rsquo;s a&#xA;cultural problem that you&amp;rsquo;re facing, and you can work around it if you know where it stems from.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Can be used as a reference tool, getting to the part you need in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of Leadership</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very much like &amp;ldquo;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&amp;rdquo;, this is another book you should keep on your desk&#xA;and access randomly as you need it. Most of the &amp;ldquo;small things&amp;rdquo; target upper management&#xA;but I recommend this book to line managers and individual contributors too as this is&#xA;a good reference for what you should expect from your manager.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Resilient Management</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I liked the fact that the book is short, goes straight to the point, contains mostly&#xA;practical advices and methods to manage an engineering team (the target audience in my&#xA;opinion is line managers). Similarly to &amp;ldquo;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Path&amp;rdquo; by Camille Fournier, you&#xA;can keep this book on your desk and use it whenever you need it, like a manual.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was skeptical at first because leadership and management style in the military are not really&#xA;my cup of tea, but this is different: the author seems to have the same feelings, except he was&#xA;a submarine commander in the US Navy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I read this book because a colleague highly recommended it to me, but it took me a while to get into it. The basic&#xA;concept of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation is really easy to grasp, but at a first glance the book might seem&#xA;repetitive. Well, it&amp;rsquo;s not, and the many details and nuances around the main concept are the real value proposition&#xA;of this book.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I collected plenty of highlights from the book that apply to both my work and personal experience, note for myself: go&#xA;review them periodically!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend picking this up as the traditional &amp;ldquo;management manual&amp;rdquo;, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work like that :).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I believe this is the mother of all the management books I&amp;rsquo;ve read so far: I can trace&#xA;back most of the concepts that nowadays are common in engineering management to a&#xA;paragraph, or a simple quote from this book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
