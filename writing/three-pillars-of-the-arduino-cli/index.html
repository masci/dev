<p>The Arduino CLI is an open-source command line application written in Golang that can be used from a terminal to
compile, verify and upload sketches to Arduino boards, and that’s capable of managing all the software and tools
needed in the process. But don’t get fooled by its name: the Arduino CLI can do much more than the average
console application, as shown by the Pro IDE and Arduino Create, which rely on it for similar purposes but each
one in a completely different way from the other.</p>
<p>In this article, we introduce the three pillars of the Arduino CLI, explaining how we designed the software so
that it can be effectively leveraged under different scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="the-first-pillar-command-line-interface">The first pillar: command line interface</h2>
<h3 id="console-applications-for-humans">Console applications for humans</h3>
<p>As you might expect, the first way to use the Arduino CLI is from a terminal and by a human, and user experience
plays a key role here. The UX is under a continuous improvement process as we want the tool to be powerful
without being too complicated. We heavily rely on sub-commands to provide a rich set of different operations
logically grouped together, so that users can easily explore the interface while getting very specific contextual
help.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="console-applications-for-robots">Console applications for robots</h3>
<p>Humans are not the only type of customers we want to support and the Arduino CLI was also designed to be used
programmatically — think about automation pipelines or a CI/CD system.</p>
<p>There are some niceties to observe when you write software that’s supposed to be easy to run when unattended and
one in particular is the ability to run without a configuration file. This is possible because every
configuration option you find in the arduino-cli.yaml configuration file can be provided either through a command
line flag or by setting an environment variable. To give an example, the following commands are all equivalent
and will proceed fetching the unstable package index that can be used to work with experimental versions of cores:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/arduino-cli-core.png" width="100%"><figcaption>
      <h4>Arduino CLI core management</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>See the <a href="https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/latest/configuration/">documentation</a> for details about Arduino
CLI’s configuration system.</p>
<p>Consistent with the previous paragraph, when it comes to providing output the Arduino CLI aims to be user
friendly but also slightly verbose, something that doesn’t play well with robots. This is why we added an option
to provide output that’s easy to parse. For example, the following figure shows what getting the software version
in JSON format looks like.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/arduino-cli-version-json.png" width="100%"><figcaption>
      <h4>Arduino CLI version, JSON format</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Even if not related to software design, one last feature that’s worth mentioning is the availability of a
one-line installation script that can be used to make the latest version of the Arduino CLI available on most
systems with an HTTP client like curl or wget and a shell like bash.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-pillar-grpc-interface">The second pillar: gRPC interface</h2>
<p>gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework that can efficiently connect client and server applications. The Arduino
CLI can act as a gRPC server (we call it daemon mode), exposing a set of procedures that implement the very same
set of features of the command line interface and waiting for clients to connect and use them. To give an idea,
the following is some Golang code capable of retrieving the version number of a remote running Arduino CLI server
instance:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/arduino-cli-main.png" width="100%"><figcaption>
      <h4>gRPC client example</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>gRPC is language-agnostic: even if the example is written in Golang, the programming language used for the client
can be Python, JavaScript or any of the many supported ones, leading to a variety of possible scenarios. The new
Arduino Pro IDE is a good example of how to leverage the daemon mode of the Arduino CLI with a clean separation
of concerns: the Pro IDE knows nothing about how to download a core, compile a sketch or talk to an Arduino board
and it demands all these features of an Arduino CLI instance. Conversely, the Arduino CLI doesn’t even know that
the client that’s connected is the Pro IDE, and neither does it care.</p>
<h2 id="the-third-pillar-embedding">The third pillar: embedding</h2>
<p>The Arduino CLI is written in Golang and the code is organized in a way that makes it easy to use it as a library
by including the modules you need in another Golang application at compile time. Both the first and second
pillars rely on a common Golang API, a set of functions that abstract all the functionalities offered by the
Arduino CLI, so that when we provide a fix or a new feature, they are automatically available to both the command
line and gRPC interfaces.</p>
<p>The source modules implementing this API can be imported in other Golang programs to embed a full-fledged Arduino
CLI. For example, this is how some backend services powering Arduino Create can compile sketches and manage
libraries. Just to give you a taste of what it means to embed the Arduino CLI, here is how to search for a core
using the API:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/arduino-cli-embed.png" width="100%"><figcaption>
      <h4>Arduino CLI embedding example</h4>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Embedding the Arduino CLI is limited to Golang applications and requires a deep knowledge of its internals. For
the average use case, the gRPC interface might be a better alternative; nevertheless this remains a valid option
that we use and provide support for.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>You can start playing with the Arduino CLI right away. The code is open source and we provide extensive
documentation. The repo contains example code showing how to implement a gRPC client, and if you’re curious about
how we designed the low-level API, have a look at the commands package and don’t hesitate to leave feedback on
the issue tracker if you’ve got a use case that doesn’t fit one of the three pillars.</p>
