From time to time, I get various declinations of the same question: _why did you decide to move
to engineering management?_ It's not necessarily in job interviews: it might be a colleague, somebody
I'm mentoring, or a friend of mine. Even my wife asks, sometimes out of genuine curiosity, other
times more in a _"why did you do this to yourself"_ fashion - so I thought it might be interesting to
articulate an answer in written form.

### Foreword

First of all, I'd like to clarify that I don't consider moving to management a definitive choice
for my career. I'm a big fan of the [pendulum](https://charity.wtf/2017/05/11/the-engineer-manager-pendulum/) concept, and I've being swinging way
before I knew how it was called, jumping back and forth between coding and different degrees of
leadership roles:

> IC (9y) -> Tech/Team Lead (5y) -> IC (1y) -> Team Lead (2y) -> IC (2y) -> Team Lead (1y _so far_)

These days I'm working hard to become a better engineering manager, but I can't exclude that I might
go back to full time coding in the future, hopefully even as a better programmer. I like to talk
a lot about [drivers](https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/) in my job, so here follows a list of what
_drives_ me towards engineering management.

### Driver n.1: Amplifying

Often times I took the lateral step to management because I needed to move forward something that
was just too heavy for an IC: one time it was to organize a team the way I envisioned, another time to help
with hiring, another time to deliver a risky project that was stalling, or that time that I picked
up the lead role on the team that nobody wanted to join (probably the biggest success in my career
so far ❤️). I like to build stuff that works and that's useful to people, and as an IC this can be
achieved through a very well crafted piece of code implementing a certain feature; but as a manager,
I can achieve a goal through a full fledged team capable of a bigger impact on the product than my
code alone could ever have.

### Driver n.2: Talent Spotting

At the risk of sounding blatant, I would say I'm a more than decent software engineer at this
point. Still, there's something I can do even better: it takes me no time to tell when I'm not
the best engineer in the room, and when this happens, I tend to naturally switch into low-ego
mode and do my part, eager to learn more than to lead. This helped me countless times and gave
me the opportunity to learn a lot from complex projects (and complex people), even when my
contributions were modest. As an engineering manager, I very often leverage this attitude to
acknowledge somebody's potential and do whatever I can to let it emerge, and this feels as good
and natural to me as writing good code.

### Driver n.3: Climbing the ladder (please don't do this)

It happened that being able to climb the career ladder in a company was part of my decision process to
accept a management role. While there are still companies that (irresponsibly) don't provide a career path
for ICs, this shouldn't be a valid reason to switch to management: I got lucky and things turned out good
for me in the end, but what if I became unsatisfied or even frustrated for not getting what I expected?
The risk is to **actually hurt people**, and rest assured most of those issues are not fixable.

### Conclusions

I like mentioning these three drivers when I try to explain why did I become an engineering manager,
but reality is obviously more complex than this. Since I tend to go back and forth between coding and
management, I find myself in the need to make decisions more often than people with a more "stable"
career, and the factors contributing to such decisions are many and possibly different
every time. Several of those are negative factors (frustration, money, pride, boredom even) so it's
important for me to recognize them and bring back the focus solely on drivers number one and two.
