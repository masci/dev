This book is a masterpiece: the metaphor of the atlas, the many thorough notes, the data behind each chapter is just
amazing. The author also shows fine technical skills that let her jump from politics to hardware and algorithms
flawlessly as the narrative requires. This book is an eye-opener for those who think about modern AI as "software",
whereas the environmental and human costs are massive.
