Must-read for anybody interacting with other cultures, whether it's for work or not. I had several ah-ah! moments
reading the book, it can be a life-saver if you struggle at times navigating people situations: very often it's a
cultural problem that you're facing, and you can work around it if you know where it stems from.

Can be used as a reference tool, getting to the part you need in the moment.
