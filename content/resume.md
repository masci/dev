## Experience

### LlamaIndex, SF (Remote) {icon="/img/llamaindex.png"}
**Founding Engineer** *6/2024 - 9/2025*

Working on the Open Source Al framework **LlamaIndex**, I introduced the [Workflows](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-workflows-beta-a-new-way-to-create-complex-ai-applications-with-llamaindex) concept, a novel abstraction
designed to ease the development of Al applications. Workflows became a foundational part of the project and were also
[featured](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/announcing-our-series-a-and-llamacloud-general-availability) in our Series A
announcement.

I deeply refactored the **LlamaDeploy** project, introducing new concepts like the
[Api Server](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/llama_deploy/20_core_components/#api-server) in order
to achieve my vision of Al workloads deployment at scale.

As a founding engineer in a small team working at a very fast
pace, I also had the chance to work on the platform backend, security compliance, developers tooling and blog authoring.

### deepset, Berlin (Remote) {icon="/img/deepset.png"}
**Team Lead, Open Source Engineering** *5/2022 - 6/2024*

Working on the Open Source NLP framework Haystack, I was responsible for its major rewrite, released in March 2024 with
the version 2.0.0. I influenced and designed many of the [key concepts](https://haystack.deepset.ai/blog/haystack-2-release)
introduced with the new version, making the framework flexible and extensible.

On top of shaping and leading the technical vision for Haystack, being part of an early stage startup, I was
responsible of several aspects of my team:
- In collaboration with several stakeholders: defining, planning and executing the product roadmap
- Developing talent, establishing career goals and growth plans for the engineers reporting to me
- Hiring

### Elastic, Remote {icon="/img/elastic.png"}
**Senior Engineering Manager** *7/2020 - 5/2022*

Led a fast-paced, globally distributed team working on the infrastructure monitoring features of the Observability
Solution, I was responsible for:
- Developing talent through coaching and mentoring, establishing career goals and growth plans
- Collaborating with product management to develop and implement our roadmap through planning and prioritisation
- Ensuring efficient delivery of our goals within time-boxed releases
- Improving communication, hiring, and onboarding processes as the team scaled

### Arduino, Turin (Remote) {icon="/img/arduino.png"}
**Senior Software Engineer** *6/2019-7/2020*

Led the refactoring of the Arduino CLI, an open source core product written in Golang that sits behind the new Pro IDE
and Arduino's SaaS offer. Reshaped the infrastructure and delivery pipeline of our SaaS products on top of Kubernetes,
Ambassador, Helm and GitHub Actions in order to:
- reduce the time to market of new features and bug fixes
- easily deliver POCs and POVs
- support backend and frontend engineers deploying software with confidence
- make observability first class citizen

### Datadog, NYC (Remote) {icon="/img/datadog.png"}
**Staff Engineer** *1/2019-5/2019*

Designed and implemented the strategy to transition the Python interpreter embedded with the Datadog Agent from version
2.7 to version 3.7. Main goal was to minimize impact on users during the transition: the project involved tricky
technical problems to be solved, a plan to roll out the feature in time before Python 2 was retired while facing the
challenges of an invasive refactoring performed on a codebase that was under heavy development.

### Datadog, NYC (Remote) {icon="/img/datadog.png"}
**Engineering Team Lead** *4/2018 - 1/2019*

Took the lead of a brand new team focused on delivering the new Agent based integrations while keeping existing ones
up and running. I gave priority to making the process frictionless for engineers, introducing idiomatic tools and new
workflows aimed to ease the work on a local dev environment. The feedback from people contributing to the codebase was
very positive and my mentoring efforts were extremely rewarding with one intern hired full time at the end of her
internship.

### Datadog, Paris then NYC (Remote) {icon="/img/datadog.png"}
**Engineering Team Lead** *4/2017 - 4/2018*

Team lead for the Agent and Integrations engineering team, we delivered version 6.0 of the Datadog Agent in February
2018. Designed and started the refactoring of Agent based integrations from single-module Python files to wheel
packages (https://github.com/DataDog/integrations-core). Transitioned a small team of 2 engineers working on
container-specific Integrations into a full-fledged engineering team.

### Datadog, Paris {icon="/img/datadog.png"}
**Software Engineer** *2/2016 - 4/2017*

Worked in the Agent and Integrations team on metrics collection. Authored the first version of the Kubernetes State
agent check and the AWS ECS crawler. Designed and implemented the port of the Datadog Agent to Golang
(https://github.com/DataDog/datadog-agent).

### Self Employed (Remote) {icon="/img/massi.png"}
**Software Engineer** *5/2015- 1/2016*

Involved in several projects as a consultant, mostly on backend web services written in Python and Django.

### Evonove, Perugia {icon="/img/evonove.png"}
**Cofounder and Tech Lead** *1/2010 - 4/2015*

Involved in several projects managing people, writing Python (mostly Django) and C++ code (mostly Qt), deploying web
applications, integrating software components, and writing documentation. I was responsible for choosing tools and
technologies.

### Molecular Discovery Ltd, London (Remote) {icon="/img/moldiscovery.png"}
**Software Engineer** *1/2010 - 4/2015*

I developed multiplatform, commercial cheminformatic desktop softwares with Qt libraries in C and C++. I worked in a
team environment under short deadlines in more than a project.
